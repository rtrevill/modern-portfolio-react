# Modern Protfolio - React

Being a web developer means being part of a community. 

Being part of this community requires you share information freely. This way, ideas can grow and improvements to systems can continue as internet speeds increase and hardware becomes more powerful.

Showing your abilities in different technologies can provide potential employers your skillsets, and distributing your functional applications can provide motivation and de-mystification of some technologies to those who are new to the area of coding.

This application is a demonstration of using React to create a single page portfolio that can have multiple pages, while being able to receive inputs from a contact form, and provides links to projects accomplished using different web development technologies.

## Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer  
WHEN I load the portfolio

WHEN I view the header  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio  
WHEN I view the navigation titles  
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted  
WHEN I click on a navigation title  
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted  
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time  
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default  
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section  
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them  
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section  
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository  
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section  
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message  
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text  
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required  
WHEN I enter text into the email address field  
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
